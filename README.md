This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Editor Theme (WebStorm)

This project recommends a cool hacker-style dark theme for WebStorm.

What we set up
- Project-level plugin recommendation: Dracula Theme (clean, high-contrast hacker dark theme).
  - When you open the project, WebStorm should prompt you to install the recommended plugin.

How to apply the theme
1) In WebStorm, open Settings > Plugins and install “Dracula Theme” if prompted (or search the Marketplace for "Dracula Theme").
2) Go to Settings > Appearance & Behavior > Appearance and set Theme = Dracula.
3) (Optional) Go to Settings > Editor > Color Scheme and select a Dracula-based scheme if available.

Notes
- JetBrains IDE themes are user-level preferences; the project can recommend plugins but cannot force a theme automatically.
- If you prefer a different hacker-style theme, you can also try Material Theme UI (Darker/One Dark) from the Marketplace.


## Available WebStorm Themes

Here are common options you can use in WebStorm. Themes fall into two categories: IDE UI themes and editor color schemes. Many plugins provide both.

Built-in themes (no plugin required)
- Light — default light UI
- Light with Light Header — light UI with lighter title/header
- Darcula — classic dark UI theme
- High Contrast — increased contrast for accessibility
